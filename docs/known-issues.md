# Known issues and open items

Items left open on purpose. Each one says why it was left and
what would change that decision.

## Performance

- **Rejected: demux PID peek.** Skipping unwanted PIDs before parsing measured
  103 ms vs 105 ms per 400 MB, which is no gain, so it was not kept.

## Audio

- **TrueHD and DTS-HD play through their lossy cores.** The output is a stereo 48 kHz downmix,
  so decoding MLP or XLL would not be audible. *Revisit if* multichannel or high-resolution output is added.
- **A play item without the selected audio stream** gets no audio units. The audio clock then behaves as for any gap
  in the audio (it can drop to buffering until video read-ahead fills). Blu-ray discs carry every stream in every
  play item, so nothing fills the gap. *Revisit if* a real disc shows it.
- **The last E-AC-3 access unit before the end of input is not played** (32 ms), because a group is emitted when
  the next one starts.
- **AC-3 at 44.1 or 32 kHz is ignored** (treated as no sync). Blu-ray AC-3 is always 48 kHz.
- **An unplayable or unloadable codec in a later play item** makes `onAudioUnit` retry the decoder load on every
  unit, with no notice to the user. *Revisit if* a disc mixes codecs across play items, or after the final review fixes it.
- **When a decoder fails to load during a seek,** audio buffered before the seek can keep playing, because
  `audioUnavailable` does not stop the ring. *Revisit if* a decoder load can fail in practice, or after the final review fixes it.

## Resolved (for reference)

- **File version checks** now match libbluray's `bdmv_parse_header`
  (`0100`, `0200`, `0240`, `0300`), checked against a libbluray clone at 448f896.
- **CLPI coding type `0xa0`** reads a stream language, as libbluray does.
- **Case-colliding disc file names** (for example `00001.m2ts` and `00001.M2TS` in one folder)
  are now refused with a `case-collision` error that names both files.
  Before, one of the two was dropped silently.
- **Open-GOP leading-picture skip is verified on the real disc.**
  78 of 123 sampled entry points on `TSURUNE_TSUNAGARI_1` are non-IDR recovery points with leading pictures.
  In Chrome (which reports hardware H.264 support on this machine), 8 seeks all started on open-GOP keyframes
  and skipped 15 leading pictures, with 0 decoder errors and 0 audio underruns.
  The decoder now reports `openGopStarts` and `leadingPicturesSkipped` in telemetry,
  and `LOCAL_DISCS=1 npx playwright test local-discs` repeats the check.
- **The audio worklet's BigInt counter write was measured.** The BigInt load and store take about 21 ns (Node, Apple silicon).
  A whole `renderQuantum` takes under 0.4 µs (this figure includes the writer's work).
  That is under 0.02% of the 2.67 ms budget per 128-frame quantum at 48 kHz, so the counter was kept.
- **The fake `VideoDecoder` can deliver output late** (`asyncOutput` and `deliver()`, with `reset()` leaving
  queued output in place). The fake exposed a real gap: a frame from before a seek that arrived after `reset()`
  would have been presented. `WebCodecsVideoDecoder` now passes on only frames whose chunks it fed since the last reset.
- **The chapter guard is checked directly.** Tests cover skipping a chapter that starts under 0.5 s ahead.
  They also check that "next chapter" on the last chapter leaves the clock advancing,
  with no state change and no seek.
- **The `fsevents` install-script warning** is silenced (`"fsevents": false` in `allowScripts`).
- **Abandoned prefetch reads are cancelled.** `ByteSource.read` takes an `AbortSignal`.
  With a signal, `FileSource` reads through `Blob.stream()`, which measured as fast as `arrayBuffer()` in Chrome
  (200 MB in 84–98 ms vs 83–97 ms on the local disc). `PlaybackPipeline.stop()` and each new item cancel the old reader.
- **Holding or slowly dragging the seek bar snapped back.** On release Chrome can fire a trailing `change`
  after `pointerup`. Once the drag value had been cleared, it carried the old playback time, which seeked back there.
  The seek bar now holds the committed target until the engine reports reaching it, and ignores that repeat.
  Holding a control also keeps the controls from hiding.
- **E2E A/V sync bounds on CI.** The tests stay at 20 ms mean and 50 ms max offset locally (macOS: 11–15 ms and 21 ms).
  Ubuntu 24.04 containers with a PulseAudio null sink measured up to 15 ms mean and 41 ms max on native arm64,
  and up to 19 ms mean and 41 ms max on emulated amd64, which is close to the bounds.
  CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) therefore runs with `SYNC_TOLERANCE_SCALE=1.5` (30 ms / 75 ms).
  *Revisit if* GitHub runs log `sync stats` well inside 20/50 ms, then drop the scale back to 1.
